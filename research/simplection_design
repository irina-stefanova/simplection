Canvas Graph - the most flexible graph in the world, which esentially can be used even for drawing

A. Requirements
	1. To be able to create all Telerik Reporting graph types
		- Line charts (smooth, stepped, straight(arcs or really straight))
		- Area (smooth, stepped, straight(arcs or really straight))
		- Bars (control bar width)
		- Pie (and other pies that are not Stacked 100)
		- Doughnut
		- Line polar (radar) (smooth, stepped, straight(arcs or really straight))
		- Area polar (filled radar) (smooth, stepped, straight(arcs or really straight))
		- Bar polar (rose radar)
		- Polar graph starting angle, direction, inner radius (for doughnut), sweep? angle (for semi circles)
		- Move axis and represent axis labels and ticks as table or other
		- Clustered, Stacked, Stacked 100%, Overlapped, Range
		- Markers
		- Bubble (marker size)
		- Line, area, marker fill and border (color, stepped color, linear gradient, radial gradient, pattern)
		- Conditional formatting
	2. Build on top of that
		- True stack/ranged graphs with more than 2 values (this will enable Gantt, Candlestick and other charts)
		- Represent tables as charts
		- Polar tables
		- Multiple graph plots (sub graphs) in the same graph
		- Infographics - shape bars and areas or add shapes on top
		- Tree maps
		- Interactivity - tooltips, graph sections zoom in, follow cursor with a line and a point on the data path, comments on items
		- Drill down interactivity
		- Drill through interactivity
		- Graph markers (graph in graph)
		- Smart labels
		- Other crazy types (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/03/business/20080403_SPENDING_GRAPHIC.html?_r=0)
	3. Maps
		- Real world maps
		- Political maps (choropleth)
	
B. Work
	1. Concentrate on the plot, forget (for now) about the axis and other components
